// Worker channel configuration (GET/PUT /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/...).
//
// Each worker's qwenpaw app (effective console port, default 8088) exposes
// the full channel-configuration API used by the QwenPaw console Channels
// page. The Controller proxies a fixed surface so that L1 admins and L2
// humans can graphically connect channels (QQ / Matrix / DingTalk / ...) to
// agents in their teams without SSH or docker access:
//
//	GET  /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels                 all channel configs
//	GET  /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/types           channel name list
//	GET  /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/schemas         per-channel form schemas (UI render driver)
//	GET  /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/{channel}       single channel config
//	PUT  /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/{channel}       update (body = full channel config)
//	GET  /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/{channel}/health
//	GET  /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/{channel}/qrcode
//	GET  /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/{channel}/qrcode/status
//	POST /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/{channel}/restart
//	POST /api/v1/workers/{name}/channels/{channel}/conflict-check
//
// Upstream contract: requests are forwarded to the worker's qwenpaw config
// API under /api/config/channels/... — the path the worker's own client
// (qwenpaw_worker/api.py) and integration coverage use. The proxy is
// version-agnostic: the 9-route core contract is identical across the
// official QwenPaw 2.0.1 / 2.2.0 / 2.2.1 releases (see the version-contract
// section of docs/design/worker-channels-api.md). conflict-check is an
// additive 2.2.x-only route: 2.2.x workers serve it (config.py:379), and a
// worker on an older build returns its own 404, which the proxy passes
// through verbatim (version gate).
//
// Design notes (full contract in docs/design/worker-channels-api.md):
//
//   - Single-agent worker context: without an X-Agent-Id header the worker's
//     qwenpaw app resolves the "active agent from config", which in a
//     single-profile worker container is the worker's own agent — so the
//     global (non-agent-scoped) path targets the right agent.
//   - PUT is the qwenpaw-authoritative write path: upstream validates the
//     payload (pydantic), persists it into agent.json and hot-reloads the
//     channel (no worker restart). The worker's push_loop then propagates
//     the file to the MinIO baseline that mirror_all pulls on rebuild; the
//     read-back below covers the persistence gap that burned manual edits.
//   - Read contract (round-trip, by design): credential values round-trip
//     unmasked. Rationale: scoped callers can only reach agents in their own
//     teams (W8), and the config form needs the saved values to round-trip
//     unchanged. Decided per #1220 §13 Q5 (2026-09-16) — maintainer
//     confirmation requested in the PR; a masked read would be a separate
//     change (mask helper + a reveal capability), not a config flag.
//     L3 (worker-scoped) readers are the exception — they may read normal
//     config/status of assigned workers but not plaintext credentials, so
//     the channel-config reads are sanitized server-side for them
//     (credential fields omitted, maintainer decision, #1277 review).
//   - Write contract: the handler is the real boundary (middleware
//     requires): team leaders are read-only on channels (403 on mutations);
//     L2 humans are scoped to their accessibleTeams (W8: 404, never 403, so
//     cross-team existence cannot be probed) and may write non-credential
//     fields by default. A PUT is diffed against the saved channel config
//     before the write: credential fields (channelCredentialKeys) whose
//     value is unchanged are ordinary fields; replacing a value or
//     explicitly clearing it (empty string) additionally requires the
//     channel_secrets capability for L2 callers and is audit-logged for
//     every role. Credential fields omitted from the body are back-filled
//     from the saved values, because upstream replaces the whole channel
//     (config_class(**body)) — an omitted secret would otherwise be erased
//     by the model default. admin/manager are exempt from the gate (their
//     changed credential writes are audit-logged, not gated).
//   - Read-back contract (async): a successful PUT answers immediately with
//     X-AgentTeams-MinIO-Persisted: "pending"; a background re-check at a
//     conservative bound beyond the worker push_loop sync interval records
//     the convergence result in the audit log. The old bounded in-request
//     polling budget (3x2s) was systematically false-negative against the
//     push_loop (#1220 §11).
