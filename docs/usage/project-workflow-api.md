# Project / Workflow Inspection API

> Added by the project workflow inspection PR (agentteams/AgentTeams#1169).

The controller exposes four read-only endpoints that surface TeamHarness
project state (`shared/projects/{id}/meta.json`) as a LangGraph-aligned
workflow view, plus per-team spawn subagent sessions and their conversation
streams. They are the data source for human-facing views (dashboard, QwenPaw
console plugin) and are consumed by `agt get projects`.

## Scope & prerequisites

These endpoints work in **any AgentTeams deployment** that runs TeamHarness
(projectflow/taskflow) on its workers — the storage layout is read through
the controller's configured object-store client, so `AGENTTEAMS_STORAGE_PREFIX`
and `AGENTTEAMS_FS_BUCKET` (including non-default values) are handled
automatically; no per-deployment code or configuration is required.

Prerequisites:

* TeamHarness MCP (`plugins/teamharness`) is installed on the workers that
  orchestrate projects. Only projects created by `projectflow`
  (`create_project` / `create_quick_project`) produce the
  `shared/projects/{id}/meta.json` that these endpoints read. Teams that
  manage tasks manually without projectflow have no project data — that is
  expected, not a bug.
* Project writes are pushed to shared storage by `_sync_project`
  (introduced alongside this API), so the controller sees near-live state
  rather than a startup snapshot.

Deployment modes (embedded Docker, incluster K8s) are all supported; in the
no-K8s development mode the controller skips authentication like the other
endpoints, so RBAC applies only when an authenticator is configured.

## Endpoints

### `GET /api/v1/projects`

List projects across all teams (and the global `shared/projects/` prefix).

Query parameters:

| Param | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `team` | Return only projects whose team matches. Team leaders are already scoped to their own team(s); standalone projects (empty team) only match when no filter is set. |

Response `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "demo-project-001",
      "title": "Demo project",
      "status": "active",
      "plan_type": "dag",
      "team_id": "biz-team",
      "mode": "project"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

* `status` is the raw project status written by TeamHarness:
  `active` | `paused` | `completed`.
* Projects are sorted by `project_id`. Duplicate ids across prefixes are
  de-duplicated (meta.json may be mirrored under both the effective team name
  and the CR name prefix).
* Projects with a missing or malformed `meta.json` are skipped (the directory
  may exist while the file is mid-write upstream).

### `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/workflow`

Return the LangGraph-aligned workflow for one project.

Optional query parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `includeTasks` | `bool` | When `true`, also read each task's TaskMeta (`shared/tasks/{id}/meta.json`) and attach a `tasks_detail` array with spec/result/deliverable fields, the opaque `submission_id` fence, and the transition `history` audit trail (omitted for metas that predate it). Default `false` keeps the response lightweight. |
| `format` | `string` | Response format. Default (absent or empty) returns the JSON snapshot above. `format=mermaid` returns the same snapshot rendered as a Mermaid flowchart (`text/plain`, no `tasks_detail` — rendering needs only nodes/edges/next). Any other value returns `400`. |

Mermaid output (`?format=mermaid`) mirrors LangGraph's `draw_mermaid` helper: each node label is `name: status`, next/ready nodes get the `ready` highlight class, and every other node gets a status class (`pending` / `delegated` / `inProgress` / `completed` / `revision` / `blocked`). All classDefs are emitted so the graph renders standalone. Task titles and ids are user-controlled, so they are sanitized for mermaid safety: newlines become `<br>`, double quotes become `#quot;`, backslashes are dropped, and other control characters become spaces; a task id containing characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` is mapped to a collision-safe node id (labels keep the original text). A malformed title therefore can never alter the rendered graph structure. Example:

```text
flowchart LR
    t1["Task 1: completed"]:::completed
    t2["Task 2: delegated"]:::ready
    t1 --> t2
    classDef ready fill:#d4edda,stroke:#28a745;
    ...
```

Each `tasks_detail[]` entry carries `history: []` — the task's auditable
state transitions recorded by the TeamHarness transition engine, oldest
first. Entry shape:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-09-09T10:00:05Z",
  "from": "assigned",
  "to": "in_progress",
  "action": "ack_task",
  "actor": "worker:default",
  "note": ""
}
```

`action` is one of `delegate_task`, `ack_task`, `submit_task`,
`accept_task_result`, `cancel_task`, `progress`; `actor` is `role:account`
(MCP transitions) or the authorization actor (controller cancellations).
The allowed transitions are defined by the shared contract
`plugins/teamharness/contracts/task-transitions.json`.

Response `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "project_id": "demo-project-001",
  "title": "Demo project",
  "status": "active",
  "plan_type": "dag",
  "team_id": "biz-team",
  "mode": "project",
  "source": "dingtalk",
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "t1", "name": "Task 1", "status": "completed", "assignee": "@w1:matrix.local"},
    {"id": "t2", "name": "Task 2", "status": "delegated", "assignee": "@w2:matrix.local"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"source": "t1", "target": "t2", "conditional": false}
  ],
  "next": ["t2"],
  "interrupts": [
    {"id": "t3", "value": "blocked"},
    {"id": "loop", "value": "waiting for human decision"}
  ],
  "values": {
    "project_id": "demo-project-001",
    "title": "Demo project",
    "status": "active",
    "plan_type": "dag",
    "team_id": "biz-team",
    "mode": "project",
    "task_count": {"completed": 1, "delegated": 1}
  },
  "loop": null,
  "requester": "dingtalk:user:session",
  "source_room_id": "!room:matrix.local",
  "tasks_detail": [
    {
      "task_id": "t1",
      "project_id": "demo-project-001",
      "status": "completed",
      "spec_path": "shared/tasks/t1/spec.md",
      "assigned_to": "@w1:matrix.local",
      "summary": "Alpha report done",
      "result_status": "SUCCESS",
      "submission_id": "submission-123",
      "deliverables": [{"type": "file", "path": "shared/tasks/t1/output.pdf"}],
      "result_path": "shared/tasks/t1/result.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

`tasks_detail` is only present when `?includeTasks=true`. It surfaces the
TaskMeta fields that the project-level `nodes[]` summary does not carry:
`spec_path` (task spec file), `summary` / `result_status` / `result_path`
(submission result), `deliverables` (artifact list), `cancel_reason`, and the
opaque `submission_id` used to fence accept/cancel decisions.
TaskMeta is read from the project's owning scope only: team projects read
`teams/{team}/shared/tasks/{id}/meta.json`, standalone projects read
`shared/tasks/{id}/meta.json`. There is no cross-scope fallback, and a
TaskMeta whose `project_id` names a different project is rejected — an
unrelated task that happens to share the id can never mix in. Tasks without
a TaskMeta file (e.g. not yet delegated) are skipped; per-task read errors
are skipped so one bad task never fails the whole response.

Node statuses are normalized to a frontend-friendly enum:

| API value | Raw TeamHarness status |
|:--|:--|
| `pending` | `planned` |
| `delegated` | `assigned` |
| `in-progress` | `in_progress`, `submitted` |
| `completed` | `completed` |
| `revision` | `revision` |
| `blocked` | `blocked`, `cancelled` |

Semantics (mirror upstream `_ready_nodes` / `_ready_loop_nodes`):

* `next` — ready nodes: tasks whose raw status is `planned`/`assigned` and
  whose dependencies are all `completed`. Empty when the project is not active
  or a loop is `waiting_user` / `blocked` / `completed`.
* `interrupts` — human-decision waiting points: a blocked task, or a loop in
  `waiting_user` / `blocked` state.
* `values.task_count` — node counts per normalized status.

Error responses:

| Code | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `400` | Missing project id. |
| `403` | Authenticated but the role cannot read projects at all (e.g. Worker). |
| `404` | Project not found (no meta.json under any scanned prefix) — **or** the caller is a scoped reader (team leader / L2 human) who does not own the project (existence is hidden to prevent id enumeration). |
| `500` | K8s or object-store failure. |

### `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}`

Node-level inspection for one task: aggregates the task's graph node (status,
assignee, dependencies), its TaskMeta (spec/summary/result/deliverables), the
append-only transition history, and a trace hint for deep-linking into a
tracing backend.

```text
GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}?team=alpha-team
```

Response `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "task_id": "t1",
  "project_id": "demo-project-001",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "spec_path": "shared/tasks/t1/spec.md",
  "assigned_to": "@w1:matrix.local",
  "summary": "Alpha report done",
  "result_status": "SUCCESS",
  "result_path": "shared/tasks/t1/result.md",
  "deliverables": [{"type": "file", "path": "shared/tasks/t1/output.pdf"}],
  "history": [
    {"ts": "2026-09-05T01:00:00Z", "from": "", "to": "planned", "actor": "manager", "action": "create"},
    {"ts": "2026-09-05T02:00:00Z", "from": "planned", "to": "in_progress", "actor": "w1", "action": "ack_task"},
    {"ts": "2026-09-05T03:00:00Z", "from": "in_progress", "to": "submitted", "actor": "w1", "action": "submit_task"}
  ],
  "dependencies": [],
  "trace": {"project_id": "demo-project-001", "task_id": "t1"}
}
```

Field notes:

- `submission_id`, when present in TaskMeta, is returned verbatim. Pass it as
  `submissionId` when cancelling that submission.
- `status` is the **raw** TaskMeta status when TaskMeta exists (same
  semantics as `tasks_detail` with `?includeTasks=true`); when TaskMeta is
  absent it falls back to the normalized graph-node status
  (`pending | delegated | in-progress | completed | revision | blocked`).
- `history` is populated by TeamHarness taskflow (and the controller's
  cancel path) as an append-only audit of accepted transitions, capped at 50
  entries; it is empty until the workflow transition engine lands
  (design: agentscope-ai/AgentTeams#1223). Malformed entries are skipped,
  never an error.
- `trace` is a tracing-backend filter hint: its `project_id` / `task_id` are
  the values to match against the span attributes `agentteams.project.id` /
  `agentteams.task.id`, which worker entry spans already carry. No backend
  URL is constructed here; the tracing backend is deployment-specific.
- TaskMeta is read from the project's owning scope only (team prefix first,
  global prefix only for standalone projects) — the same no-cross-scope
  fallback rule as `tasks_detail`.

Errors: `400` (missing/invalid task id), `404` (project not found —
existence-hidden for scoped callers — or task not in this project's graph),
`500` (storage read failure).

### `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}/artifact`

Download one of a task's artifacts, completing the "deliverable → download →
review → accept" loop for dashboards and the console plugin.

Optional query parameter:

| Param | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `path` | The artifact path to download. Must be one of the task's **declared** artifacts — `result_path`, `spec_path` or an entry of `deliverables` (all read from TaskMeta). When omitted, the `result_path` (the published result) is served. |

Without `?path=` the artifact is the task's `result_path` (published result).
With `?path=` the requested path must be one of the task's declared artifacts
— `result_path`, `spec_path` (task spec) or a `deliverables` entry. The path
is then validated against a strict allowlist: it must be under
`shared/tasks/{taskId}/` or `shared/projects/{projectId}/`, and must not
contain `..` or start with `/`. Because the allowlist AND the declared-artifact
check both apply, a compromised worker cannot craft a path that reads
arbitrary MinIO objects, nor can a client download an undeclared file that
happens to live in the task directory.

The file is returned with `Content-Disposition: attachment` (filename =
basename, RFC 5987 `filename*=utf-8''...` for non-ASCII names so Chinese
filenames download correctly) and a `Content-Type` inferred from the
extension.

Error responses:

| Code | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `400` | Missing project id or task id. |
| `403` | Authenticated but the role cannot read projects at all (e.g. Worker). |
| `404` | Project not found / caller does not own it (existence hidden) / task not in the project graph / task has no published artifact / requested path is not a declared artifact / artifact file missing / artifact path rejected / TaskMeta exists only outside the project's scope or belongs to another project. |
| `500` | K8s or object-store failure. |

### `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/spawns`

Aggregate the **spawn subagent sessions** created by the project team's
workers. Spawn subagents are the primary execution vehicle of worker agents
(workers schedule, spawns execute); this endpoint makes that activity
visible alongside the team-level task graph.

Data source: each team worker's `chats.json`
(`agents/{worker}/.qwenpaw/workspaces/default/chats.json` in object storage,
mirrored by the worker's FileSync). A chat entry is a spawn session when
`meta.spawn == true` (QwenPaw 2.1+) or its `session_id` carries the `sub-`
prefix (2.0.1 fallback).

Response:

```json
{
  "project_id": "demo-project-001",
  "workers": [
    {
      "worker": "sysdev-lead",
      "spawns": [
        {
          "session_id": "sub-3f2a9b1c",
          "name": "fix harmony build script",
          "status": "running",
          "created_at": "2026-08-13T10:00:00+00:00",
          "updated_at": "2026-08-13T10:05:00+00:00",
          "root_session_id": "matrix:!room:server",
          "spawn": true,
          "subagent_allowed_tools": ["read_file", "write_file"],
          "subagent_skills": ["pdf"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- `root_session_id` is the normalized session key of the parent session
  (`matrix:` prefix canonicalized) — the session that called
  `spawn_subagent`. The endpoint is **project-scoped, not team-scoped**: a
  spawn is listed only when its root session is one of the project's rooms
  (the project `source_room_id` or a graph task's `TaskMeta.room_id`). A
  spawn rooted elsewhere — another project's room, or a legacy 2.0.1 spawn
  without a persisted root — is **omitted**, never attached to every project
  of the team.
- A worker with a missing or unreadable `chats.json` is still listed, with
  an empty `spawns` array — one broken worker never 500s the whole project.
- `subagent_allowed_tools` / `subagent_skills` are only present when the
  spawn was created with a tool/skill whitelist (2.1+).
- `name` is the chat title assigned when the spawn session was created
  (not the full task prompt).
- Standalone projects (no owning team) return an empty `workers` array —
  there is no team membership to derive the worker list from.

Error responses:

| Code | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `400` | Missing project id. |
| `403` | Authenticated but the role cannot read projects at all (e.g. Worker). |
| `404` | Project not found / caller does not own it (existence hidden). |
| `500` | K8s or object-store failure. |

### `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/spawns/{sessionId}/messages`

Returns one spawn session's **conversation stream** — user context messages,
model turns and tool results — so a client can show what the spawn is doing,
its full task prompt, and its progress. The stream is read from the owning
worker's `history.db` (QwenPaw's scroll `HistoryStore`, mirrored into object
storage by the worker FileSync alongside `chats.json`).

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `limit` | int | `20` | Number of messages (most recent window). Capped at `50`. |

Response:

```json
{
  "session_id": "sub-3f2a9b1c",
  "task": "Design the auth module",
  "messages": [
    {
      "seq": 1,
      "kind": "context_msg",
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Design the auth module",
      "created_at": "2026-08-13T15:00:00"
    },
    {
      "seq": 2,
      "kind": "model_turn",
      "role": "assistant",
      "name": "read_file",
      "content": "Reading the spec first",
      "headline": "read spec",
      "created_at": "2026-08-13T15:00:05"
    },
    {
      "seq": 3,
      "kind": "tool_result",
      "role": "assistant",
      "name": "read_file",
      "content": "spec.md contents",
      "tool_state": "success",
      "created_at": "2026-08-13T15:00:06"
    }
  ],
  "has_more": false
}
```

- `kind` is one of `context_msg` (user message), `model_turn` (assistant
  reply — `headline` is the turn's retrieval headline, "what it is doing at
  a glance"), or `tool_result` (tool execution result — `name` is the tool
  and `tool_state` its final state).
- `task` is the first user message of the session — the spawn task text.
- `messages` is ascending (oldest first), covering the most recent `limit`
  rows; `has_more` reports whether older rows exist.
- The database is pulled to a temp dir and opened strictly read-only
  (pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite`), with a fallback that reads the
  checkpointed portion when the WAL sidecars are missing or inconsistent.
  The schema is stable across QwenPaw 2.0.1 and 2.1.
- An empty session (db present, no rows) returns `200` with `messages: []`.

Error responses:

| Code | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `400` | Missing project id or session id. |
| `403` | Authenticated but the role cannot read projects at all (e.g. Worker). |
| `404` | Project not found / caller does not own it (existence hidden) / session not owned by any team worker / `history.db` missing or unreadable. |
| `500` | K8s or object-store failure. |

### `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/history`

Returns the project's **intervention timeline** — the pre-intervention
`meta.json` snapshots written by the lifecycle endpoints (see
`POST /pause`, `POST /resume`, … below; each intervention snapshots the
previous state into `history/{unixNano}.json`, retaining the most recent 50).

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `team` | string | — | Optional team qualifier, same semantics as the other read endpoints. |

Response:

```json
{
  "project_id": "demo-project-001",
  "snapshots": [
    { "timestamp": "1723785123456789012" }
  ]
}
```

- `snapshots` is **newest first**. `timestamp` is the snapshot filename
  (unix nanoseconds) and is kept as a **string** — 19-digit nanosecond
  values exceed the JavaScript safe-integer range, so numeric transport
  would silently lose precision.
- An empty history returns `200` with `"snapshots": []`.

### `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/history/{timestamp}`

Returns one snapshot's raw `meta.json` content **verbatim** (same schema as
`GET /workflow`'s source). `timestamp` must be a 19-digit unixNano value;
anything else is rejected `400` (this doubles as the traversal guard).

Error responses:

| Code | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `400` | Missing project id / malformed timestamp. |
| `403` | Authenticated but the role cannot read projects at all (e.g. Worker). |
| `404` | Project or snapshot not found / caller does not own it (existence hidden). |
| `409` | Ambiguous project id across teams; retry with `?team=`. |
| `500` | K8s or object-store failure. |

### `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/events`

Returns the project's **task transition timeline** — a read-time
aggregation of every task's `history` array (the same audit trail
`?includeTasks=true` exposes per task), merged into one **ascending** list.
No new storage: the endpoint reads the task metas on demand and does not
add a write-side hook. Project-level intervention events are **not** part
of this timeline — use `GET /history` for those; the two are
complementary.

Query parameters:

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `team` | string | — | Optional team qualifier, same semantics as the other read endpoints. |
| `limit` | int | `50` | Page size. Capped at `200`; values `< 1` are rejected `400`. |
| `cursor` | string | — | Opaque cursor from a previous page's `next_cursor`; pass it back to continue. Encodes the page's last event identity (ts, task_id, seq), so it stays valid while new events are appended — and even while the per-task 50-entry history cap drops already-read events. For seq-less legacy events that share one second (the same identity), it additionally pins the event's position within that duplicate group, so paging always advances. |

Response:

```json
{
  "project_id": "demo-project-001",
  "events": [
    {
      "ts": "2026-09-09T10:00:00Z",
      "task_id": "t1",
      "from": "planned",
      "to": "prepared",
      "action": "delegate_task",
      "actor": "leader:default",
      "seq": 1
    },
    {
      "ts": "2026-09-09T10:00:05Z",
      "task_id": "t1",
      "from": "assigned",
      "to": "in_progress",
      "action": "ack_task",
      "actor": "worker:default",
      "note": "starting",
      "seq": 2
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": "eyJ0cyI6IjIwMjYt..."
}
```

- `events` is **oldest first**; the shared second-resolution timestamps are
  tie-broken by `task_id`, and events sharing both keep the writer's append
  order (`seq`), so paging is deterministic.
- Every event carries `seq`, the writer-persisted per-task sequence number:
  the stable event identity. Timestamps are second-resolution and repeated
  progress entries are allowed, so content alone cannot identify an event.
- `next_cursor` is empty when the tail was reached; an empty project
  returns `200` with `"events": []`.
- `next_cursor` is an opaque, URL-safe string. The client never parses it;
  it anchors on the page's last event by exact identity (ts, task_id, seq),
  so appending new events between page requests does not invalidate it and
  duplicates (same second, same content) are never skipped or repeated. A
  cursor anchored inside a group of seq-less legacy duplicates (same
  second, no `seq`) carries the event's occurrence index within the group
  plus a snapshot of the list length, so paging such groups — including
  completed read-only histories that will never receive a `seq` backfill —
  advances exactly one event per page and can never stall.
- `cursor_expired` is `true` (with `"events": []` and no `next_cursor`)
  when the cursor's anchor event has been truncated out of the retained
  per-task history (50 entries, oldest dropped), the snapshot behind a
  legacy duplicate cursor was truncated (its position in the duplicate
  group may have shifted), or the cursor predates the sequence format. On
  that signal the client must discard the cursor and re-fetch from the
  start; continuing would otherwise skip unread events silently.
- Task metas are read from the project's owning scope only — no
  cross-scope fallback (same rule as `tasks_detail`).

Error responses:

| Code | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `400` | Missing project id / invalid `limit` or `cursor`. |
| `403` | Authenticated but the role cannot read projects at all (e.g. Worker). |
| `404` | Project not found / caller does not own it (existence hidden). |
| `409` | Ambiguous project id across teams; retry with `?team=`. |
| `500` | K8s or object-store failure. |

## Project identity & disambiguation

Project ids are only unique within a worker workspace upstream: two teams can
hold the same project id. The API therefore treats `(team, project_id)` as
the identity:

- `GET /api/v1/projects` lists every distinct `(team, project_id)` — the same
  id under two teams appears twice, disambiguated by `team_id` (a scoped
  caller only sees the entries of their accessible teams).
- The read endpoints (`workflow`, `tasks/{taskId}/artifact`, `spawns`,
  `spawns/{sessionId}/messages`, `history`, `history/{timestamp}`) accept an
  optional `?team=` query parameter that narrows resolution to that team's
  storage prefix.
- Without `?team=`, if the same project id exists under multiple teams the
  endpoint returns `409 Conflict` (`project id is ambiguous across teams;
  retry with ?team=`) instead of silently resolving to the first match.
  Callers scoped to one of those teams (team leader / L2 human) resolve their
  own team's project without ambiguity.

## Authentication & authorization

Two bearer-token paths are accepted (composite authenticator):

1. **Kubernetes service-account token** (TokenReview): admin / manager /
   worker. Team leaders (worker with `team_leader` role) see only their own
   team's projects.
2. **Matrix access token** (L2 humans): the token is validated with
   `GET /_matrix/client/v3/account/whoami`; the owning Matrix localpart is
   matched to a `Human` CR with `permissionLevel: 2` (Team). The human's
   `accessibleTeams` set is used as the multi-team scope — every team they
   control is aggregated into a single list/read view. Non-L2 humans
   (permissionLevel 1 or 3) are rejected.

Authorization matrix:

| Caller | List | Get workflow | Get spawns | Get spawn messages | Get history |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| admin / manager | all teams | any project | any project | any project | any project |
| team-leader (SA) | own team only | own team only | own team only | own team only | own team only |
| L2 human (Matrix) | all `accessibleTeams` | any accessible team | any accessible team | any accessible team | any accessible team |
| worker | denied | denied | denied | denied | denied |

## `agt` CLI

`agt get projects [name]` wraps both endpoints:

```bash
agt get projects                      # list all
agt get projects --team biz-team      # filter by team
agt get projects demo-project-001     # workflow detail
agt get projects demo-project-001 -o json
agt get projects demo-project-001 --mermaid   # render DAG as mermaid (status classes)
```

`--mermaid` uses the same renderer as the API's `?format=mermaid`: next/ready
nodes are highlighted and every node is colored by status (see the workflow
endpoint section above).

Node-level inspection has no dedicated CLI verb yet; use the API directly:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTTEAMS_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  "$AGENTTEAMS_API_BASE/api/v1/projects/demo-project-001/tasks/t1"
```

The CLI forwards whatever bearer token is configured (`AGENTTEAMS_AUTH_TOKEN`
or `AGENTTEAMS_AUTH_TOKEN_FILE`) verbatim, so an L2 human can also use it by
pointing either variable at their own Matrix access token — no separate CLI
auth mode is needed.

## Human intervention & lifecycle endpoints

The read endpoints above are complemented by write endpoints that let
humans intervene in agent-orchestrated workflows. All writes are code-level
authorized: the middleware rejects cross-team writes (authorizer
`requireSameTeam`), and the handler additionally runs `checkProjectAccess`
after resolving the owning team because the middleware cannot map a project
path to a team. Every write is stamped with audit fields
(`updated_by` / `updated_at`, and `pause_reason` when a reason is given) and
applies an ETag conditional write — the object's ETag (content hash) is
bound at read time and the write is a MinIO If-Match conditional write, so
a worker pushing a newer `meta.json` between the read and the write makes
the write fail with `409` instead of clobbering it.

### `POST /api/v1/projects`

Create a project (structured, aligned with TeamHarness `create_project`).
An admin/manager may create a standalone project without a team; a team
leader or L2 human must pass a `team_id` they can access.

Request body:

```json
{
  "title": "New project",
  "source": "matrix",
  "requester": "@carol:server",
  "team_id": "biz-team",
  "project_id": "optional-custom-id",
  "source_room_id": "!room:server"
}
```

`project_id` defaults to a generated value when omitted and must be a plain
token matching TeamHarness `_safe_id` (`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*`); the
generated default is a compact timestamp + nanoseconds (never an RFC3339
timestamp — its `:` would be rejected by TeamHarness). Response `201 Created`:

```json
{
  "project_id": "proj-20260814-160628-406426239",
  "title": "New project",
  "status": "active",
  "team_id": "biz-team",
  "plan_type": "dag"
}
```

Errors: `400` missing/invalid title or project id / team required for
scoped callers; `409` project already exists; `403`/`404` cross-team
(denied / existence hidden).

### `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/pause`

Set a project's status to `paused`. Pausing stops new task dispatch
(`ready_nodes` returns empty) but does not interrupt in-flight tasks; their
completion reports still arrive (documented behavior — in-flight work is
not cancelled). Optional body `{"reason": "..."}` is recorded in
`pause_reason`. Response `200` returns the updated workflow
(`buildWorkflow`). Errors: `409` already paused / completed; `404` not
found or not owned.

### `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/resume`

Set a paused project back to `active`. Response `200` returns the updated
workflow. Errors: `409` not paused; `404` not found or not owned.

### `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/replan`

Replace a project's DAG plan. The request body carries the new tasks
(optional `tasks` array):

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"taskId": "t1", "title": "Step 1", "assignedTo": "@dev:server", "dependsOn": []},
    {"taskId": "t2", "title": "Step 2", "dependsOn": ["t1"]}
  ]
}
```

Fields are normalized like TeamHarness `_normalize_task`
(`taskId`/`task_id`, `assignedTo`/`assigned_to`, `dependsOn`/`depends_on`,
status defaults to `planned`, `pending` maps to `planned`); a task id that
already exists keeps its previous title/assignee/status when the raw entry
omits them. Validation mirrors `_validate_task_graph`: duplicate ids,
unknown dependencies, and dependency cycles are rejected with `400`.
Preconditions (`409`): `plan_type` must be `dag` (loop replans go through
`record_loop_iteration`), status must be `active`, and no task may be
`in_progress`/`submitted`. Response `200` returns the updated workflow.
Tasks with a persisted cancellation decision keep that decision when retained
in a replan. They cannot be reopened or removed and then re-added under the
same task id; create a new task id for replacement work.

### `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}/cancel`

Cancel a single task:

```json
{
  "reason": "no longer needed",
  "replacementTaskId": "replacement-01",
  "submissionId": "submission-123"
}
```

`reason` is required and `replacementTaskId` is optional. `submissionId` is
conditionally required: when TaskMeta already has `submission_id`, callers
must send that exact opaque value. Missing, invented, or stale identities are
rejected before either ProjectMeta or TaskMeta is changed.

On success, the project node and TaskMeta become `cancelled`; TaskMeta records
stable `cancel_reason` / `replacement_task_id` / `cancelled_at` fields and
resolves an existing pending continuation as `cancelled` without changing its
`delivery_id`. Repeating the same cancellation is idempotent. A different
reason, replacement task, or submission identity conflicts with the committed
decision. Tasks already `completed`, `revision`, or `blocked` cannot be
cancelled. Response `200` returns the updated workflow.

The Controller writes a small cancellation decision envelope into the project
node before writing TaskMeta. If the second write fails, an identical retry can
finish the TaskMeta/continuation update; a retry with a different reason,
replacement, or submission identity is rejected.

Errors: `400` missing reason or invalid replacement task id; `404` task not in project / task meta missing;
`409` terminal task, submission fence failure, or conflicting cancellation.

### `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/complete`

Mark a project completed (terminal state). All tasks must be in a terminal
status (completed/revision/blocked/cancelled — no in_progress/submitted/
planned), otherwise `409`. Response `200` returns the updated workflow.

### Notifications

After a successful write, the Controller sends an admin message
(`SendMessageAsAdmin`) to the project's `source_room_id` (falling back to
`reply_route.target_session`), so agents in that room learn about the
intervention without polling. Best-effort: no notification is sent when
the room is unknown or Matrix is not configured.

## Authentication & authorization

Two bearer-token paths are accepted (composite authenticator):

1. **Kubernetes service-account token** (TokenReview): admin / manager /
   worker. Team leaders (worker with `team_leader` role) see only their own
   team's projects.
2. **Matrix access token** (L2 humans): the token is validated with
   `GET /_matrix/client/v3/account/whoami`; the owning Matrix localpart is
   matched to a `Human` CR with `permissionLevel: 2` (Team). The human's
   `accessibleTeams` set is used as the multi-team scope — every team they
   control is aggregated into a single list/read view. Non-L2 humans
   (permissionLevel 1 or 3) are rejected.

Authorization matrix:

| Caller | List | Get workflow | Write (create/pause/resume/replan/cancel/complete) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| admin / manager | all teams | any project | any project |
| team-leader (SA) | own team only | own team only | own team only |
| L2 human (Matrix) | all `accessibleTeams` | any accessible team | any accessible team |
| worker | denied | denied | denied |

## `agt` CLI

`agt get projects [name]` wraps both endpoints:

```bash
agt get projects                      # list all
agt get projects --team biz-team      # filter by team
agt get projects demo-project-001     # workflow detail
agt get projects demo-project-001 -o json
agt get projects demo-project-001 --include-tasks -o json
agt get projects demo-project-001 --mermaid   # render DAG as mermaid (status classes)
```

`--mermaid` uses the same renderer as the API's `?format=mermaid`: next/ready
nodes are highlighted and every node is colored by status (see the workflow
endpoint section above).

Node-level inspection has no dedicated CLI verb yet; use the API directly:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTTEAMS_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  "$AGENTTEAMS_API_BASE/api/v1/projects/demo-project-001/tasks/t1"
```

The CLI forwards whatever bearer token is configured (`AGENTTEAMS_AUTH_TOKEN`
or `AGENTTEAMS_AUTH_TOKEN_FILE`) verbatim, so an L2 human can also use it by
pointing either variable at their own Matrix access token — no separate CLI
auth mode is needed.

`--include-tasks` requires `-o json`; the default detail view does not render
raw TaskMeta fields.

### `agt project` (the lifecycle write API write commands)

`agt project` wraps the write endpoints so a human can intervene without
raw curl:

```bash
agt project create --title "New project" --team biz-team --source matrix
agt project pause demo-project-001 --reason "customer review"
agt project resume demo-project-001
agt project replan demo-project-001 --tasks tasks.json   # JSON array file
agt project cancel demo-project-001 demo-project-001-01 \
  --reason "no longer needed" --submission-id submission-123 --team biz-team
agt project complete demo-project-001
```

The same bearer-token forwarding applies (Matrix token for L2 humans).

## Worker checkpoint endpoints

The Controller proxies two read-only endpoints of each worker's QwenPaw app
(checkpoint system, QwenPaw ≥ 2.1) so humans and frontends can inspect a
worker's execution timeline — auto snapshots after every response round plus
manual `/checkpoint snapshot`, stored in the worker's `checkpoints/shadow.git`.

| Endpoint | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}/checkpoints/graph` | Checkpoint graph (nodes with kind/timestamp/query preview, sessions, summary). Optional `?limit=` (1..1000). |
| `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}/checkpoints/status` | `auto_enabled`, `has_checkpoints`, `workspace_dir`. |

- **Scope**: same worker read authorization as `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}`
  — team leaders / L2 humans only see workers in their teams; unknown or
  out-of-scope workers are hidden as `404`.
- **Embedded mode only**: the endpoints proxy the worker's qwenpaw app inside
  the shared docker network. The upstream address is resolved from the
  effective container prefix (`AGENTTEAMS_PROXY_CONTAINER_PREFIX`, or derived
  from `AGENTTEAMS_RESOURCE_PREFIX` when auto-prefixing is enabled; empty when
  disabled — the same value the docker backend uses for container naming) and
  the effective console port resolved through the same system-wins env chain
  used at container creation (the system env always defines
  `AGENTTEAMS_CONSOLE_PORT`, so a conflicting `Worker.spec.env` value is
  discarded and the container always listens on `8088`). In kube mode
  they return `503`.
- **Degradation**: a worker running QwenPaw < 2.1 has no checkpoint router,
  so the upstream `404` is translated to `502` with
  `checkpoint API unavailable (requires QwenPaw 2.1)`.
- Forwarding is fixed-path (graph / status) with a strict query whitelist —
  not a generic reverse proxy.

Error responses:

| Code | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `400` | Invalid worker name / unsupported subpath or query parameter / invalid `limit`. |
| `404` | Worker not found / caller does not own it (existence hidden). |
| `502` | Worker app unreachable, pre-2.1 checkpoint API, or upstream error. |
| `503` | Kube mode (no stable worker pod DNS to proxy). |

## Worker knowledge base (workspace files) endpoints

The Controller proxies four endpoints of each worker's QwenPaw app
(QwenPaw ≥ 2.1) so L2 humans and frontends can inspect — and, where the
caller's Human CR permits, update — a worker's knowledge base: the
long-term memory file `MEMORY.md`, the daily note tree `memory/`, and the
distilled knowledge tree `digest/`.

| Endpoint | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}/workspace-files/tree` | Paginated listing of one knowledge directory: `?path=` (required, `memory` / `digest` or any subpath of them), optional `?cursor=` (opaque) and `?limit=` (1..500). Returns `{directory, entries[], has_more, next_cursor}`. |
| `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}/workspace-files/file-metadata` | `?path=` (required, an allowed knowledge file): `{etag, modified_at, path, preview_kind, size}`. |
| `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}/workspace-files/file-content` | `?path=` (required) plus optional `?offset=` (≥0) and `?limit=` (1..1048576): a bounded UTF-8 chunk `{content, eof, next_offset, truncated, etag, ...}` — continue with `offset=next_offset` while `truncated` is true. |
| `PUT /api/v1/workers/{name}/workspace-files/file-content` | Save one knowledge file: `?path=` (required), body `{"content": "<text>"}` (1 MiB cap, non-empty) and the `If-Match` header (see the concurrency rule below). Returns the new `{etag, path, size}`. |
| `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}/workspace-files/file-download` | Stream one knowledge file as an attachment: `?path=` (required). Forwards the upstream `Content-Disposition` / `Content-Length` / `ETag` headers. |

- **Scope**: same worker read authorization as `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}`
  and the checkpoint endpoints — team leaders / L2 humans only see workers
  in their accessible teams; unknown or out-of-scope workers are hidden as
  `404`.
- **Write scope**: `PUT file-content` is allowed for admin/manager (any
  team); an L2 human may write only workers in their own teams while
  `Human.spec.workspaceFileAccess` is explicitly `"readwrite"` — the
  default is `read` (an empty or unset value means read-only), so a
  controller upgrade cannot silently grant pre-existing humans write
  access; L1 grants a user write access by setting the field to
  `readwrite`. Team leaders stay read-only on this API. Cross-team writes
  hide the worker as `404` (existence must not be probeable); an in-scope
  caller without write permission gets an explicit `403`.
- **Concurrency (ETag)**: before a write the proxy probes `file-metadata`.
  For an existing file the `If-Match` header is mandatory (a worker
  auto-appends to its memory files, so an unconditional overwrite would be
  a lost update) and for a new file it must be absent. An upstream ETag
  mismatch passes through as `409` — reload the file and retry.
- **Write limits**: the body is capped at 1 MiB (the read chunk cap),
  `content` must be a non-empty string, and every successful write is
  audit-logged by the controller (worker, path, caller, byte count).
- **`workspaceFileAccess` (Human CRD field)**: `read` | `readwrite`
  (default is `read` when empty — write is an explicit opt-in) — the
  per-user read/write permission L1 can set on a human's access to team
  knowledge base files. Settable at human creation (`agt apply`) and
  through `PUT /api/v1/humans/{name}` (that update API carries the field
  in its updatable set, shipped with the humans-update PR).
- **Path allowlist (knowledge boundary)**: only `MEMORY.md`,
  `memory/**` and `digest/**` are addressable — for reads and writes
  alike. Every other workspace
  location — `SOUL.md`, `PROFILE.md`, `TODO.md`, `checkpoints/`, `skills/`,
  and all dot directories (`.copaw/agent.json` carries the worker's
  credentials) — is rejected with `400` before the request reaches the
  worker. Roots match on the exact first segment, so `memories/` and
  `memoryX/` are not prefixes of `memory/`. File roots are single
  top-level files: `MEMORY.md` is addressable, but `MEMORY.md/foo` is
  rejected (`MEMORY.md` is one file, not a directory — nested files must
  live under `memory/` or `digest/`).
- **Root pinned**: the QwenPaw `root=workspace` parameter (the agent's own
  storage root, as opposed to `root=project`, the primary bound project
  directory) is fixed server-side and is not part of the client query
  surface.
- **Embedded mode only**: the endpoints proxy the worker's qwenpaw app
  inside the shared docker network, using the effective container prefix
  and the system-wins console port — the same address resolution as the
  checkpoint endpoints. In kube mode they return `503`.
- **Version gate (passthrough 404)**: a worker running QwenPaw < 2.1 has no
  workspace file router, so every request is an upstream `404` passed
  through verbatim. To distinguish "worker too old" from "file missing",
  probe `file-metadata?path=MEMORY.md` — that file exists in every
  initialized QwenPaw workspace, so a `404` there means the worker is
  pre-2.1 (or its workspace is not initialized) while other `404`s are
  plain missing files.
- **Runtime scope**: the endpoints target workers running the QwenPaw app
  (`qwenpaw` runtime). Workers on other runtimes have no QwenPaw workspace
  API: when that runtime's app serves the console port the proxy passes its
  response through verbatim (typically `404`); when nothing listens it
  returns `502`. The MEMORY.md probe is therefore only meaningful for
  QwenPaw workers.
- Forwarding is fixed-path (tree / file-metadata / file-content GET+PUT /
  file-download) with a strict query whitelist — not a generic reverse
  proxy. The multipart `file-upload` endpoint and the rest of the
  workspace API surface remain unreachable.

## Worker tool-approval endpoints

Each QwenPaw worker's agent profile carries a tool-execution security level
(`approval_level` in the worker's `agent.json`) that decides which tool calls
run automatically and which pause for a human approval. The Controller
proxies a minimal read/write surface of the worker's
`/workspace/running-config` API so L2 humans can manage this level for
workers in their own teams:

| Endpoint | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}/approval` | Current level: `{"approval_level": "AUTO"}`. |
| `PUT /api/v1/workers/{name}/approval` | Set the level. Body: `{"approval_level": "STRICT"}`. |

- **Levels**: `STRICT` (every tool call needs approval) / `SMART` (low-risk
  tools auto-allowed) / `AUTO` (only guarded tools — the upstream default) /
  `OFF` (guard disabled). Any other value is rejected with `400` before the
  worker is touched (the upstream model does not validate the value — the
  proxy is the validation boundary).
- **OFF is elevated**: `approval_level=OFF` disables Tool Guard entirely, so
  it is a security-policy operation rather than ordinary configuration.
  Default L2 humans get `403` on `OFF` — they may switch among the guarded
  levels (`STRICT`/`SMART`/`AUTO`) only. `OFF` requires the elevated
  tool-approval capability that the L2 permission design (#1220) defines and
  admins grant explicitly; admin/manager keep the full range until that
  capability model lands.
- **Write scope**: `PUT` is allowed for admin/manager (any team); an L2 human
  may set only workers in their own teams — cross-team workers hide as `404`
  (existence is not probeable). Team leaders stay read-only (`403` on `PUT`,
  the same boundary as the knowledge base write API).
- **Safe write**: the upstream `PUT /workspace/running-config` persists the
  *full* running-config object, so the proxy performs GET → change only
  `approval_level` → PUT the whole object back; every other field round trips
  verbatim. An upstream `409` (concurrent config change) is passed through so
  clients retry with a fresh `GET`.
- **Embedded mode only**: same worker addressing as the checkpoint proxy
  (effective container prefix + system-wins console port). Kube mode returns
  `503`.
- **Degradation**: a worker on a QwenPaw version without the running-config
  router surfaces the upstream `404` verbatim (version gate).
- Every successful change is audit-logged (worker, new level, caller, role).

Error responses:

| Code | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `400` | Invalid worker name / unsupported subpath or query parameter / path outside the knowledge allowlist / out-of-bounds `limit` or `offset` / (write) missing or misplaced `If-Match`, over-size or empty body. |
| `403` | (write only) in-scope caller without write permission — read-only human or team leader. |
| `404` | Worker not found or not in the caller's teams (existence hidden); or (passthrough) the file does not exist — see the version-gate probe above. |
| `409` / `416` | (passthrough) the file changed while being read / while waiting for the write (ETag mismatch — reload and retry) / offset beyond end of file. |
| `502` | Worker app unreachable, or an upstream error (status echoed in the body). |

| `400` | Invalid worker name / invalid request body / `approval_level` not in the fixed set. |
| `403` | Team leader attempting `PUT` (read-only) / L2 human setting `OFF` (elevated capability required, #1220). |
| `404` | Worker not found / caller does not own it (existence hidden) / pre-2.x worker (version gate, passthrough). |
| `409` | Concurrent upstream config change (retry with a fresh `GET`). |
| `502` | Worker app unreachable or upstream error. |
| `503` | Kube mode (no stable worker pod DNS to proxy). |

## Worker tool-settings endpoints

Each QwenPaw worker's agent profile carries a per-tool table
(`tools.builtin_tools`): which built-in tools are enabled and which execute
asynchronously. The Controller proxies a minimal read/write surface of the
worker's `/api/tools` API so L2 humans can manage the tools of workers in
their own teams — no `docker exec` required.

| Endpoint | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `GET /api/v1/workers/{name}/tools` | Tool list: `{"tools": [ {name, enabled, description, asyncExecution, icon, requiresConfig}, ... ], "total": N}`. |
| `PATCH /api/v1/workers/{name}/tools/{tool}` | Declarative update. Body: one or both of `{"enabled": bool, "asyncExecution": bool}`. |

- **Declarative, retry-safe**: the proxy reads the current table first and
  issues the worker-local mutation only for each field whose requested value
  differs from the current one (the worker-local toggle endpoint flips state
  without a body, so a bare forward would double-flip on a retry). A PATCH
  that changes nothing is a `200` no-op with zero upstream writes.
- **Concurrent-safe**: because the worker-local enabled mutation is a blind
  toggle, the read-decide-mutate sequence runs under a per-(worker, tool)
  lock and the mutation response is verified to carry the requested
  `enabled` value. Two overlapping `PATCH {"enabled":true}` requests both
  return `200` and leave the tool enabled (the second observes the first's
  write and no-ops); a verification mismatch is a `502`, never a false `200`.
- **State only, never configuration**: the entry exposes
  `requiresConfig` (a flag) but never the tool's configuration values —
  they can hold credentials.
- **Write scope**: `PATCH` is allowed for admin/manager (any worker); an L2
  human may patch only workers in their own teams — cross-team workers hide
  as `404` (existence is not probeable). Team leaders stay read-only
  (`403` on `PATCH`, the same boundary as the approval endpoint).
- **Unknown field names are rejected** with `400` (fail-closed); the
  controller-facing names are camelCase (`asyncExecution`, `requiresConfig`).
- **Runtime-aware**: the tool-settings model is QwenPaw-specific; workers on
  another runtime surface `400`. **Embedded mode only** (kube mode `503`).
- **Failure semantics**: unknown worker/tool `404`; upstream error `502`
  (a QwenPaw build without the `/api/tools` router is a `502` "API
  unavailable"); a malformed upstream list fails closed with `502` rather
  than a partial list.
- **Live effect**: the worker-local mutation saves the agent profile and
  hot-reloads the agent; the worker's sync loop persists the profile to the
  shared store.
- Every successful change is audit-logged (worker, tool, changed fields with
  old/new values, caller, role).
